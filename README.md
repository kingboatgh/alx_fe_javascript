Welcome to the “DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and Working with JSON Data” project! In this project, you will develop a dynamic web application that generates, manages, and filters content based on user interactions. This project focuses on advanced DOM manipulation techniques, web storage, and handling JSON data.

Create and manipulate dynamic content using JavaScript.
Persist data across browser sessions using local storage and session storage.
Import and export JSON data to manage the state of your application.
Implement a dynamic content filtering system.
Sync local data with a server and handle potential conflicts.
By the end of this project, you will have a robust understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and be able to create dynamic, interactive, and persistent web applications.
